            <p>
                The goal of this web extension is to enhance your online security by detecting phishing webpages. The extension is currently in a test mode. As such, the extension will run silently (i.e., no detection notifications and website blocks) by selectively collecting and analyzing visited URLs and features related to its visual appearance. 
            </p>

            <p>
                These indicators are only stored for webpages that exhibit characteristics suggestive of potential phishing threats and for which we could not yet determine their nature (i.e., benign or malicious). 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The data empowers us to proactively safeguard against phishing attacks and the impersonation of genuine websites, ensuring your online experience remains safe and secure.
